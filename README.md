# Casio-Loopy-Fun

There's not much here for now, but I have added a capacitor map for each of the 3 boards.

You'll find datasheets for the through hole capacitors used on the I/O board and power supply board.

The main board uses all smd capacitors that are only marked with capacitance and voltage.

Keep in mind that my console is a very early production unit that uses a revision B main board
which was apparently not used for very long. Some info here may not apply to the later rev C boards.
